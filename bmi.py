        Body mass index. A measure that relates body weight to height. BMI is sometimes used to measure total body fat and whether a person is a healthy weight. Excess body fat is linked to an increased risk of some diseases including heart disease and some cancers.
        According to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index/'>Wikipedia </a>, Body mass index is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/mÂ², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
